  <h1>About 'Multilateral Organisations'</h1>
  <p>Countries participate in many multilateral (or supranational) organisations, like the United Nations, World Bank or NATO. These organisations are (partially) funded via contributions from each member country. To fulfill their duties, these organisations buy services and products from companies all over the wolrd. On this website we show which countries and companies reap the benefits of these transactions.</p>
